TechEd 2018 DAT260 Template: Developing SAP HANA Native Applications with Node.js

We are seeing the evolution from the XSJS programming model into native Node.js with its nonblocking I/O and asynchronous flow. We will see general Node.js best practices, use of NPM modules, Web sockets, and OData V4.
